# Tower
The program is looking for the solution to built a tower using the smallest number of blocks and shows this number. It uses the directed graph, kmp algorithm and the dijkstra algorithm(includes only the <iostream> library) 

The blocks.txt file contains an example of 500 blocks. The solution in this case should be equal 1982.
